    "\n",
    "Let's analyze what each component contributed to the improvement:\n",

    "### 1. **ROLE Component Impact**\n",
    "- **Before**: Generic advice lacking authority\n",
    "- **After**: Professional expertise with specific credentials (CFP, CFA)\n",
    "- **Improvement**: Establishes credibility and domain-specific knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **TASK Component Impact**  \n",
    "- **Before**: Vague \"review portfolio\" request\n",
    "- **After**: 5 specific deliverables with clear objectives\n",
    "- **Improvement**: Comprehensive analysis vs. surface-level comments\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **OUTPUT FORMAT Component Impact**\n",
    "- **Before**: Unstructured, rambling response\n",
    "- **After**: Professional report with consistent sections\n",
    "- **Improvement**: Actionable, parseable information ready for client presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **EXAMPLES Component Impact**\n",
    "- **Before**: Superficial analysis without specific guidance\n",
    "- **After**: Detailed analysis with quantitative metrics and specific recommendations\n",
    "- **Improvement**: Professional-grade depth and specificity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **CONTEXT Component Impact**\n",
    "- **Before**: Analysis in isolation\n",
    "- **After**: Market-aware, regulation-compliant, lifecycle-appropriate advice\n",
    "- **Improvement**: Realistic, informed decisions based on actual market conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cumulative Impact**: Each component builds on the others for multiplicative improvement\n",
    "2. **Professional Standards**: Well-constructed prompts produce client-ready output\n",
    "3. **Consistency**: Structured prompts deliver reliable, repeatable quality\n",
    "4. **Specificity**: Detailed components eliminate ambiguity and improve accuracy\n",
    "5. **Context Matters**: Real-world considerations dramatically improve relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Component Best Practices for Financial Services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role**: Always specify relevant credentials and expertise areas\n",
    "- **Task**: Break complex analysis into specific, measurable deliverables  \n",
    "- **Format**: Use professional report structures that integrate with business workflows\n",
    "- **Examples**: Provide concrete patterns for analysis depth and specificity\n",
    "- **Context**: Include market conditions, regulations, and client lifecycle factors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investment Advisory Platforms**: Automated portfolio analysis and recommendations\n",
    "- **Financial Planning Software**: Client report generation with professional standards\n",
    "- **Risk Assessment Systems**: Structured analysis for compliance and audit requirements\n",
    "- **Client Communication Tools**: Consistent, professional advice delivery\n",
