## The Challenge: Seeing the Difference

This exercise demonstrates the power of proper prompt construction through before/after comparisons. You'll start with terrible prompts that produce vague, generic responses and transform them into professional-grade instructions that generate bank-ready analyses.

## Your Mission: Mastering Prompt Components

You'll systematically improve prompts by adding each component:

1. **ROLE Component**: Transform generic AI into a Senior Commercial Loan Underwriter with specific expertise
2. **TASK Component**: Replace vague instructions with clear, actionable objectives
3. **OUTPUT FORMAT Component**: Convert unstructured responses into professional business documents
4. **EXAMPLES Component**: Guide AI with concrete illustrations of desired analysis quality
5. **CONTEXT Component**: Provide essential background about regulations, market conditions, and policies

## Key Learning: Each Component's Impact

### What You'll Experience:

**Starting Point**: "What do you think about this loan?"
- Vague, generic advice
- No professional terminology
- Unusable for business decisions

**After Adding Each Component**:
- **+ Role**: Professional expertise and credibility
- **+ Task**: Focused, comprehensive analysis
- **+ Format**: Structured, parseable output
- **+ Examples**: Appropriate depth and style
- **+ Context**: Informed, realistic recommendations

**Final Result**: Bank-ready loan underwriting analysis with specific financial metrics, risk assessments, and actionable recommendations.
