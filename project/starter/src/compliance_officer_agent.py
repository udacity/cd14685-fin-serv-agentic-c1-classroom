# Compliance Officer Agent - ReACT Implementation  
# TODO: Implement Compliance Officer Agent using ReACT prompting

"""
Compliance Officer Agent Module

This agent generates regulatory-compliant SAR narratives using ReACT prompting.
It takes risk analysis results and creates structured documentation for 
FinCEN submission.

YOUR TASKS:
- Study ReACT (Reasoning + Action) prompting methodology
- Design system prompt with Reasoning/Action framework
- Implement narrative generation with word limits
- Validate regulatory compliance requirements
- Create proper audit logging and error handling
