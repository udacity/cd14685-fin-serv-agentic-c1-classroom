## Project Instructions

This section should contain all the student deliverables for this project.

### Quick Testing Reference

Students should validate their implementations using the progressive test suite:

```bash
# Test individual phases as you complete them
python -m pytest tests/test_foundation.py -v      # Phase 1: Foundation
python -m pytest tests/test_risk_analyst.py -v    # Phase 2: Risk Analyst  
python -m pytest tests/test_compliance_officer.py -v # Phase 3: Compliance Officer

# Final validation - all components working together
python -m pytest tests/ -v                        # All 30 tests should pass
```

Tests automatically skip when modules aren't implemented yet, providing clear feedback on progress.when building your README file for students.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites for all modules to ensure reliability and correctness.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cd project/solution
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run individual module tests
python -m pytest tests/test_foundation.py -v        # Core data structures
python -m pytest tests/test_risk_analyst.py -v     # Chain-of-Thought agent
python -m pytest tests/test_compliance_officer.py -v # ReACT agent
```

### Test Coverage

**30 comprehensive tests** across 3 modules:
- **Foundation SAR (10 tests)**: Data validation, case creation, audit logging
- **Risk Analyst Agent (10 tests)**: Agent initialization, case analysis, error handling  
- **Compliance Officer Agent (10 tests)**: Narrative generation, regulatory compliance

### Test Results

Complete test results and validation proof available in:
- `project/solution/test_results/test_results.md` - Consolidated test results and instructions
- All tests pass with 100% success rate (3.17s execution time)
- Validates production readiness and regulatory compliance

### Break Down Tests
