## Exercise Connection
This demonstration prepares you for the hands-on exercise where you'll build your own LLM feedback loop system for stock market analysis. You'll apply the same collaborative AI principles - analyst and reviewer working together - to create self-improving investment research systems.

**Key Transfer**: The investment advisory team pattern (advisor + compliance officer) directly applies to stock analysis (market analyst + research critic), demonstrating how feedback loops enhance financial decision-making across different domains.
