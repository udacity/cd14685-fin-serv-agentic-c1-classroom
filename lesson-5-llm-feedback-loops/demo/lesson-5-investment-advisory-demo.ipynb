      "2. **Diversification Adequacy Across Asset Classes:**\n",
      "   - The recommendation includes a diversified approach across asset classes (equities, bonds, and alternatives).

      "1. **Risk Appropriateness for Client's Profile and Timeline**:\n",
      "   - The proposed asset allocation of 50% equities, 30% bonds, and 20% alternatives aligns well with Jessica's moderate risk tolerance and 5-7 year investment timeline. However, the equity exposure is relatively high for a moderate risk profile, especially considering the potential volatility of the technology sector. A slight reduction in equity exposure (e.g., to 40%) could enhance risk management.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Diversification Adequacy Across Asset Classes**:\n",
      "   - The recommendation includes a mix of equities, bonds, and alternatives, which is a positive aspect. However, within the equity allocation, the focus on technology (via QQQ) and ESG criteria may limit diversification. It would be beneficial to include a broader range of sectors or a more diversified equity fund to mitigate sector-specific risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Suitability of Specific Investment Selections**:\n",
      "   - The selected ETFs are suitable given Jessica's ESG preferences and interest in technology. However, the reliance on technology-focused ETFs (QQQ) may expose her to higher volatility. Consider recommending a broader market ETF alongside the ESG-focused options to balance growth potential with stability.\n",

      "4. **Regulatory Compliance with Investment Advisory Standards**:\n",
      "   - The recommendations appear to comply with investment advisory standards, as they consider the client's risk tolerance, investment goals, and preferences. Ensure that the rationale for each investment is clearly documented to support the suitability of the recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
