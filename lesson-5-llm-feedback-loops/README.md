# Lesson 5: LLM Feedback Loops - Stock Market Analysis

## Overview

This lesson introduces the concept of LLM-to-LLM feedback loops through a practical stock market analysis application. Students learn how to create systems where one LLM evaluates and provides feedback to improve another LLM's output, demonstrating true AI-to-AI collaboration in financial decision-making.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

1. **Understand LLM Feedback Loops**: Learn the core concept of LLM-to-LLM communication and evaluation
2. **Build Iterative Improvement Systems**: Create systems that refine outputs through feedback cycles
3. **Apply Quality Control**: Implement systematic evaluation criteria and approval processes
4. **Demonstrate AI Collaboration**: Show how multiple LLMs can work together to improve results

## Context: Stock Market Analysis

This lesson uses stock market analysis as the practical context for demonstrating LLM feedback loops:

- **Stock Analyst LLM**: Generates investment analysis and recommendations
- **Investment Critic LLM**: Reviews analysis and provides constructive feedback
- **Iterative Refinement**: Analysis improves through multiple feedback cycles
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic approval process ensures high-quality outputs

## Key Concept: LLM Feedback Loops

**LLM Feedback Loops:**
- One LLM evaluates another's output
- Contextual, reasoning-based feedback
- Immediate output improvement
- Dynamic, collaborative AI systems

## Exercise Structure

### Starter Exercise (`exercises/starter/`)
**File**: `lesson-5-stock-market-feedback.ipynb`
**Time**: 15-20 minutes

Students complete TODO sections to build a working feedback loop system:

1. **LLM Agent Definition**: Define Analyst and Critic LLM prompts
2. **Function Implementation**: Build API interaction functions
3. **Single Loop Demo**: Practice basic feedback cycle
4. **Iterative System**: Create automated feedback loop
5. **Custom Testing**: Apply to different stock scenarios

### Solution Exercise (`exercises/solution/`)
**File**: `lesson-5-stock-market-feedback-solution.ipynb`

Complete implementation demonstrating:
- Proper LLM agent prompt design
- Effective feedback loop implementation
- Quality control and approval processes
- Testing with multiple scenarios (Apple, Tesla)

## Demo Scenarios

### Apple (AAPL) Analysis
- Clear financial data for initial demonstration
- Mixed positive/negative factors
- Good baseline for feedback loop testing

### Tesla (TSLA) Analysis
- More challenging scenario with mixed signals
- Tests system's ability to handle complexity
- Demonstrates value of iterative improvement

### Custom Stock Analysis
- Student-created scenarios
- Opportunity to test different market conditions
- Practice applying learned concepts

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Analyst LLM**:
   - Role: Senior Stock Analyst
   - Task: Generate investment recommendations
   - Output: Analysis with strengths, risks, price targets

2. **Critic LLM**:
   - Role: Investment Critic and Risk Manager
   - Task: Review and provide feedback
   - Output: Specific improvement suggestions or approval

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Iterative refinement process
   - Quality scoring and approval criteria
   - Automated or manual iteration control

### Key Functions

```python
def get_analyst_analysis(market_data, previous_feedback=None)
def get_critic_feedback(analysis, market_data)
def stock_analysis_with_feedback(market_data, max_iterations=3)
```

## Real-World Applications

### Investment Research
- Multi-step analysis refinement
- Peer review and validation systems
- Quality control for research reports

### Risk Assessment
- Collaborative risk evaluation
- Multiple perspective analysis
- Error detection and correction

### Decision Support
- AI-assisted decision making
- Transparent reasoning trails
- Confidence building through iteration

### Financial Services
- Automated report generation
- Client advisory assistance
- Regulatory compliance checking
