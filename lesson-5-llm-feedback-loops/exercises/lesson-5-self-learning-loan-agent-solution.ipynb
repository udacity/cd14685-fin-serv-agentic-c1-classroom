    "- **Ground Truth**: `(Credit ‚â• 650 AND Income ‚â• $70K) OR (Credit ‚â• 700)`\n",
    "- **Learning**: Discover this hidden rule through experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§ê **Ground Truth Examples**\n",
    "- **Alice**: Credit 720 + Income $80K ‚Üí ‚úÖ SUCCESS (high credit)\n",
    "- **Bob**: Credit 650 + Income $90K ‚Üí ‚úÖ SUCCESS (medium credit + high income)  \n",
    "- **Carol**: Credit 750 + Income $45K ‚Üí ‚úÖ SUCCESS (high credit overrides low income)\n",
    "- **David**: Credit 600 + Income $40K ‚Üí ‚ùå FAILURE (doesn't meet either condition)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ **Learning Loop with Instant Feedback & Self-Correction**\n",
    "1. **See Combination** ‚Üí Agent analyzes (Credit: 650, Income: $90K)\n",
    "2. **Make Decision** ‚Üí Agent decides DENY (initially cautious)\n",
    "3. **Compare vs Ground Truth** ‚Üí Ground Truth says \"Should APPROVE!\"\n",
    "4. **Get Outcome Feedback** ‚Üí \"This would have SUCCEEDED!\"\n",
    "5. **Self-Correct** ‚Üí Agent stores: (650, $90K) = Success pattern\n",
    "6. **Apply Learning** ‚Üí Next similar case, agent approves\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ **Key Self-Correction Moments**\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 650 + Income $90K ‚Üí **Ground Truth**: \"Should APPROVE!\" ‚Üí **Learns**: This combination works (missed opportunity)\n",
    "- **Agent approves** Credit 620 + Income $60K ‚Üí **Ground Truth**: \"Should DENY!\" ‚Üí **Learns**: This combination fails (wrong approval)\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 600 + Income $40K ‚Üí **Ground Truth**: \"Should DENY!\" ‚Üí **Confirms**: Correct decision (no learning needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† **What Agent Discovers**\n",
    "- **Specific Combinations**: Agent learns exact (credit, income) pairs that work\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition**: Gradually identifies high credit OR (medium credit + high income)\n",
    "- **Rule Convergence**: Eventually discovers the hidden ground truth rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° **Why This Works Perfectly**\n",
    "- **Deterministic**: Ground truth gives consistent feedback (no randomness)\n",
    "- **Clear Patterns**: Two variables create observable combinations\n",
    "- **Instant Feedback**: Agent knows immediately if decision was correct\n",
    "- **Corrective Learning**: Wrong decisions provide precise correction\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ **Key Learning Moments**\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 650 + Income $90K ‚Üí **Feedback**: \"This SHOULD succeed!\" ‚Üí **Learns**: This combination works\n",
    "- **Agent approves** Credit 620 + Income $60K ‚Üí **Feedback**: \"This SHOULD fail!\" ‚Üí **Learns**: This combination doesn't work\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç **Observable Pattern Discovery**\n",
    "You can literally watch the agent learn:\n",
    "1. **Early**: Makes inconsistent decisions\n",
    "2. **Middle**: Starts recognizing successful combinations  \n",
    "3. **Late**: Discovers rule structure (high credit OR medium credit + high income)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Financial Application**: This is exactly how recommendation systems, credit scoring models, and risk assessment AI learn optimal decision boundaries from historical data!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Educational Value**: Students see precise moment-by-moment learning as agent discovers a complex two-variable rule through experience rather than being programmed with it."
