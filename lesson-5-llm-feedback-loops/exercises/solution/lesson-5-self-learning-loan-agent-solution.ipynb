    "## Understanding Check: Two-Variable Financial Pattern Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows **financial AI learning** with exactly TWO variables and a **ground truth rule** - perfect for understanding pattern discovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **The Two-Variable Scenario**\n",
    "- **Input**: Credit Score (300-850) + Annual Income ($20K-$200K)\n",
    "- **Decision**: APPROVE or DENY loans\n",
    "- **Ground Truth**: `(Credit ≥ 650 AND Income ≥ $70K) OR (Credit ≥ 700)`\n",
    "- **Learning**: Discover this hidden rule through experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤐 **Ground Truth Examples**\n",
    "- **Alice**: Credit 720 + Income $80K → ✅ SUCCESS (high credit)\n",
    "- **Bob**: Credit 650 + Income $90K → ✅ SUCCESS (medium credit + high income)  \n",
    "- **Carol**: Credit 750 + Income $45K → ✅ SUCCESS (high credit overrides low income)\n",
    "- **David**: Credit 600 + Income $40K → ❌ FAILURE (doesn't meet either condition)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **Learning Loop with Instant Feedback & Self-Correction**\n",
    "1. **See Combination** → Agent analyzes (Credit: 650, Income: $90K)\n",
    "2. **Make Decision** → Agent decides DENY (initially cautious)\n",
    "3. **Compare vs Ground Truth** → Ground Truth says \"Should APPROVE!\"\n",
    "4. **Get Outcome Feedback** → \"This would have SUCCEEDED!\"\n",
    "5. **Self-Correct** → Agent stores: (650, $90K) = Success pattern\n",
    "6. **Apply Learning** → Next similar case, agent approves\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Key Self-Correction Moments**\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 650 + Income $90K → **Ground Truth**: \"Should APPROVE!\" → **Learns**: This combination works (missed opportunity)\n",
    "- **Agent approves** Credit 620 + Income $60K → **Ground Truth**: \"Should DENY!\" → **Learns**: This combination fails (wrong approval)\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 600 + Income $40K → **Ground Truth**: \"Should DENY!\" → **Confirms**: Correct decision (no learning needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **What Agent Discovers**\n",
    "- **Specific Combinations**: Agent learns exact (credit, income) pairs that work\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition**: Gradually identifies high credit OR (medium credit + high income)\n",
    "- **Rule Convergence**: Eventually discovers the hidden ground truth rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Why This Works Perfectly**\n",
    "- **Deterministic**: Ground truth gives consistent feedback (no randomness)\n",
    "- **Clear Patterns**: Two variables create observable combinations\n",
    "- **Instant Feedback**: Agent knows immediately if decision was correct\n",
    "- **Corrective Learning**: Wrong decisions provide precise correction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Key Learning Moments**\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 650 + Income $90K → **Feedback**: \"This SHOULD succeed!\" → **Learns**: This combination works\n",
    "- **Agent approves** Credit 620 + Income $60K → **Feedback**: \"This SHOULD fail!\" → **Learns**: This combination doesn't work\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **Observable Pattern Discovery**\n",
    "You can literally watch the agent learn:\n",
    "1. **Early**: Makes inconsistent decisions\n",
    "2. **Middle**: Starts recognizing successful combinations  \n",
    "3. **Late**: Discovers rule structure (high credit OR medium credit + high income)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Financial Application**: This is exactly how recommendation systems, credit scoring models, and risk assessment AI learn optimal decision boundaries from historical data!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Educational Value**: Students see precise moment-by-moment learning as agent discovers a complex two-variable rule through experience rather than being programmed with it."

    "## Understanding Check: Two-Variable Financial Pattern Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows **financial AI learning** with exactly TWO variables and a **ground truth rule** - perfect for understanding pattern discovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **The Two-Variable Scenario**\n",
    "- **Input**: Credit Score (300-850) + Annual Income ($20K-$200K)\n",
    "- **Decision**: APPROVE or DENY loans\n",
    "- **Ground Truth**: `(Credit ≥ 650 AND Income ≥ $70K) OR (Credit ≥ 700)`\n",
    "- **Learning**: Discover this hidden rule through experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤐 **Ground Truth Examples**\n",
    "- **Alice**: Credit 720 + Income $80K → ✅ SUCCESS (high credit)\n",
    "- **Bob**: Credit 650 + Income $90K → ✅ SUCCESS (medium credit + high income)  \n",
    "- **Carol**: Credit 750 + Income $45K → ✅ SUCCESS (high credit overrides low income)\n",
    "- **David**: Credit 600 + Income $40K → ❌ FAILURE (doesn't meet either condition)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **Learning Loop with Instant Feedback & Self-Correction**\n",
    "1. **See Combination** → Agent analyzes (Credit: 650, Income: $90K)\n",
    "2. **Make Decision** → Agent decides DENY (initially cautious)\n",
    "3. **Compare vs Ground Truth** → Ground Truth says \"Should APPROVE!\"\n",
    "4. **Get Outcome Feedback** → \"This would have SUCCEEDED!\"\n",
    "5. **Self-Correct** → Agent stores: (650, $90K) = Success pattern\n",
    "6. **Apply Learning** → Next similar case, agent approves\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Key Self-Correction Moments**\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 650 + Income $90K → **Ground Truth**: \"Should APPROVE!\" → **Learns**: This combination works (missed opportunity)\n",
    "- **Agent approves** Credit 620 + Income $60K → **Ground Truth**: \"Should DENY!\" → **Learns**: This combination fails (wrong approval)\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 600 + Income $40K → **Ground Truth**: \"Should DENY!\" → **Confirms**: Correct decision (no learning needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **What Agent Discovers**\n",
    "- **Specific Combinations**: Agent learns exact (credit, income) pairs that work\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition**: Gradually identifies high credit OR (medium credit + high income)\n",
    "- **Rule Convergence**: Eventually discovers the hidden ground truth rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Why This Works Perfectly**\n",
    "- **Deterministic**: Ground truth gives consistent feedback (no randomness)\n",
    "- **Clear Patterns**: Two variables create observable combinations\n",
    "- **Instant Feedback**: Agent knows immediately if decision was correct\n",
    "- **Corrective Learning**: Wrong decisions provide precise correction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Key Learning Moments**\n",
    "- **Agent denies** Credit 650 + Income $90K → **Feedback**: \"This SHOULD succeed!\" → **Learns**: This combination works\n",
    "- **Agent approves** Credit 620 + Income $60K → **Feedback**: \"This SHOULD fail!\" → **Learns**: This combination doesn't work\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **Observable Pattern Discovery**\n",
    "You can literally watch the agent learn:\n",
    "1. **Early**: Makes inconsistent decisions\n",
    "2. **Middle**: Starts recognizing successful combinations  \n",
    "3. **Late**: Discovers rule structure (high credit OR medium credit + high income)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Financial Application**: This is exactly how recommendation systems, credit scoring models, and risk assessment AI learn optimal decision boundaries from historical data!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Educational Value**: Students see precise moment-by-moment learning as agent discovers a complex two-variable rule through experience rather than being programmed with it."
