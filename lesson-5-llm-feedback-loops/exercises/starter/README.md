# Lesson 5: LLM Feedback Loops - Stock Market Analysis

## Overview

This lesson teaches students how to build LLM-to-LLM feedback systems where one AI evaluates and improves another AI's output. Students will create a stock market analysis system demonstrating true AI-to-AI collaboration in financial decision-making.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. **Understand LLM Feedback Loops**: Learn the core concept of LLM-to-LLM communication and evaluation
2. **Build Iterative Improvement Systems**: Create systems that refine outputs through feedback cycles
3. **Apply Quality Control**: Implement systematic evaluation criteria and approval processes
4. **Demonstrate AI Collaboration**: Show how multiple LLMs can work together to improve results
5. **Distinguish from Traditional ML**: Understand how this differs from conventional model training

## Exercise Structure

### üìÅ Files Included

1. **`lesson-5-stock-market-feedback.ipynb`** - Student exercise with TODO tasks (15-20 minute completion)
2. **`lesson-5-stock-market-feedback-solution.ipynb`** - Complete solution implementation

## üéØ Exercise: Stock Market Analysis with LLM Feedback Loops

### Problem Statement

Students build a two-LLM feedback system for stock market analysis:
- **Stock Analyst LLM**: Generates investment analysis and recommendations
- **Investment Critic LLM**: Reviews analysis and provides constructive feedback
- **Feedback Loop**: Analyst refines analysis based on critic feedback until approved

The system demonstrates LLM-to-LLM collaboration where AI agents work together to improve financial analysis quality.

### Key Learning Mechanisms

1. **Initial Analysis**: Analyst LLM generates investment recommendation
2. **Critical Review**: Critic LLM evaluates analysis and provides specific feedback
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Analyst incorporates feedback to revise analysis
4. **Quality Control**: Process continues until critic approves or max iterations reached

### Student Tasks (15-20 minute completion)

1. **Complete LLM Agent Prompts**: 
   - Define Stock Analyst LLM role and requirements
   - Define Investment Critic LLM evaluation criteria

2. **Implement Helper Functions**:
   - Complete `get_analyst_analysis()` with feedback handling
   - Complete `get_critic_feedback()` with evaluation logic

3. **Build Feedback Loop System**:
   - Implement single feedback cycle demonstration
   - Complete automated `stock_analysis_with_feedback()` function
   - Test with challenging stock scenarios

4. **Custom Testing**:
   - Create own stock scenario and test feedback system
   - Analyze improvement through iterations

### Demo Scenarios
- **Apple (AAPL)**: Clear scenario for initial demonstration
- **Tesla (TSLA)**: Challenging mixed-signals scenario for testing
- **Custom Stock**: Student-created scenario for practice

## üîç Expected Learning Outcomes

### LLM-to-LLM Collaboration
Students understand how different AI agents can work together:
- **Analyst LLM** focuses on generating comprehensive investment analysis
- **Critic LLM** provides systematic evaluation and improvement feedback
- **Feedback Loop** enables real-time collaboration and improvement

### Quality Improvement Through Iteration
- **First Analysis**: Often generic or missing key factors
- **Critic Feedback**: Identifies specific gaps or unclear reasoning
- **Revised Analysis**: Incorporates feedback for improved quality
- **Approval Process**: Systematic quality control with clear criteria

### Real-World Applications
Students understand how LLM feedback loops apply to:
- Investment research and report generation
- Risk assessment and peer review systems
- Automated quality control for financial analysis
- Multi-agent AI systems in financial services

## üí° Key Insights for Students

1. **LLM Collaboration**: Multiple LLMs working together can produce better results than single LLM
2. **Immediate Improvement**: Unlike ML training, improvements happen in real-time
3. **Contextual Feedback**: LLMs provide reasoning-based feedback, not just scores
4. **Quality Assurance**: Systematic evaluation creates consistent quality standards
5. **Transparency**: Clear improvement trail shows how and why analysis gets better

## üöÄ Extension Ideas

1. **Add Third LLM**: Include a risk management specialist for additional perspective
2. **Different Financial Contexts**: Apply to bond analysis, commodity markets, or forex
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Add confidence levels to recommendations
4. **Historical Validation**: Compare predictions to actual market performance
5. **Regulatory Review**: Add compliance checking as another feedback layer
6. **Portfolio Analysis**: Extend to multi-stock portfolio recommendations

## Prerequisites

- OpenAI API key configured for Vocareum environment
- Understanding of basic prompt engineering concepts
- Familiarity with financial analysis terminology
- Basic knowledge of stock market fundamentals

## Time Investment

- **Student Exercise**: 15-20 minutes to complete TODO sections
- **Solution Review**: 5-10 minutes to understand complete implementation
- **Extension Activities**: 10+ minutes for creative modifications

This exercise provides hands-on experience with LLM feedback loops and demonstrates how AI agents can collaborate to improve financial analysis quality in real-time.
