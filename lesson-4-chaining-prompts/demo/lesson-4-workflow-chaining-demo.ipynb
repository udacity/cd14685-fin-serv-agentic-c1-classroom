      "=== SINGLE PROMPT APPROACH ===\n",
      "### 1. Document Completeness Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The loan application appears to be largely complete, with the following documents provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Tax Returns:** 3 years of tax returns have been submitted, which is essential for assessing the business's financial history and performance.\n",
      "- **Bank Statements:** 6 months of bank statements are provided, allowing for an evaluation of cash flow and liquidity.\n",
      "- **Business License:** A current business license is included, confirming the legitimacy of the business operation.\n",
      "- **Equipment Quotes:** Quotes for the new kitchen equipment totaling $65,000 are provided, which aligns with the purpose of the loan.\n",
      "- **Lease Agreement:** A lease agreement with 3 years remaining is included, ensuring the business has a stable location.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Missing Documents:**\n",
      "- **Personal Financial Statement:** A personal financial statement from the owner would provide insight into personal assets and liabilities.\n",
      "- **Business Plan:** A detailed business plan outlining future projections, especially considering the seasonal nature of the business, would strengthen the application.\n",
      "- **Cash Flow Projections:** Projections for the upcoming year would help assess how the business plans to manage cash flow during the slower months.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Assessment Conclusion:** The application is mostly complete, but the addition of a personal financial statement, business plan, and cash flow projections would enhance the assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Financial Risk Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Revenue Trends:** The annual revenue shows some volatility, with a peak of $220K in 2021, a drop to $195K in 2022, and a further decline in 2023 due to external factors (local construction). This raises concerns about the sustainability of revenue, especially given the seasonal nature of the business.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Operating Expenses vs. Revenue:** With average monthly operating expenses of $12,000, the annualized expense is approximately $144,000. This indicates that the business has been operating at a profit, but the declining revenue trend could pose risks to maintaining profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Current Debt:** The existing debt of $25,000 with 18 months remaining suggests a manageable debt load. However, the business must ensure it can service this debt alongside the new loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Credit Score:** A personal credit score of 685 is considered fair, which may indicate some risk but is not a major red flag.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cash Flow Management:** The average bank balance of $8,500 is reasonable, but it is crucial to assess how this balance fluctuates throughout the year, particularly during the off-peak months.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Risk Factors:**\n",
      "- Seasonal fluctuations in revenue.\n",
      "- Recent decline in revenue due to external factors.\n",
      "- Fair personal credit score.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Final Recommendation with Loan Terms\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:** Approve the loan application for $85,000, but with caution given the identified risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Proposed Loan Terms:**\n",
      "- **Loan Amount:** $85,000\n",
      "- **Interest Rate:** 7.5% (considering the fair credit score and business risk)\n",
      "- **Loan Term:** 5 years\n",
      "- **Repayment Structure:** Monthly payments, with the first payment deferred for 3 months to allow for seasonal revenue recovery.\n",
      "- **Collateral:** The new kitchen equipment being purchased should be used as collateral for the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conditions:**\n",
      "- Require a personal financial statement from the owner.\n",
      "- Request a detailed business plan and cash flow projections for the next 12 months to better understand how the business plans to manage cash flow during slower months.\n",
      "- Monitor the business's performance closely for the first year, especially during the off-peak season.\n",
      "\n",

    "## Key Observations and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialization Wins**: Each AI agent focuses on one task, producing higher quality analysis than generalist approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation Gates Are Critical**: Pydantic models ensure data quality and catch errors early in the process\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Structured Data Flow**: Well-defined interfaces between stages enable reliable workflow orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: Workflow design allows for graceful failure handling and debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Production Ready**: Chained approach produces consistent, business-ready output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Chaining Best Practices for Financial Services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear Stage Separation**: Each stage should have a distinct, focused responsibility\n",
    "- **Strong Validation**: Use Pydantic models to validate outputs before proceeding to next stage  \n",
    "- **Structured Interfaces**: Define exact data formats for stage-to-stage communication\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Plan for validation failures and retry mechanisms\n",
    "- **Audit Trails**: Maintain complete records of each stage's analysis and decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loan Origination Systems**: Automated underwriting with human oversight points\n",
    "- **Insurance Claims Processing**: Multi-stage claim analysis and decision workflows\n",
    "- **Investment Advisory**: Systematic client analysis, risk assessment, and recommendation generation\n",
    "- **Compliance Monitoring**: Multi-step transaction analysis for regulatory reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming exercise, you'll build your own multi-stage financial compliance workflow, applying these chaining principles to create systematic, validated analysis processes for suspicious activity reporting."
