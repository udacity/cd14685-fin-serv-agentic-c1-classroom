# Lesson 2 Exercise: Suspicious Transaction Analysis with Chain-of-Thought and ReACT

## Exercise Introduction: Building Systematic Reasoning for Financial Risk Detection

You've learned about Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for systematic reasoning and ReACT framework for combining reasoning with actions. Now, you'll apply these advanced techniques to create an AI system that can analyze suspicious financial transactions with transparent, step-by-step reasoning.

### The Challenge: Creating Transparent Financial Risk Analysis

Imagine you're building an AI system for a bank's compliance team that needs to analyze potentially suspicious transactions. The system must not only identify risks but also provide clear, auditable reasoning that regulatory examiners can review. How do you create AI agents that think through complex financial scenarios step-by-step and take appropriate investigative actions?

### Your Mission: Becoming a Financial AI Reasoning Architect

In this exercise you'll build an advanced financial transaction analysis system that uses both CoT and ReACT methodologies. You will:

1. Implement **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** for systematic transaction risk analysis
2. Apply **ReACT framework** to combine reasoning with investigative actions
3. Create **transparent decision processes** that meet regulatory audit requirements
4. Build **multi-step analysis workflows** for complex suspicious activity detection

## Instructions

Follow these steps to complete the exercise in your development environment:

### Time Estimate: 15-20 minutes

### 1. Open the Notebook
Launch the "Lesson 2: Suspicious Transaction Analysis - CoT and ReACT" exercise notebook.

### 2. Initial Setup (2 minutes)
- Ensure you've installed packages: `pip install -r ../../requirements.txt`
- Your OpenAI API key is configured in the root `.env` file
- Review the suspicious transaction scenarios provided

### 3. Step 1: Basic Transaction Analysis (3 minutes)
- Find the section "1. Basic Transaction Analysis"
- Run the baseline analysis without structured reasoning
- Observe the limitations of unstructured AI responses for compliance use

### 4. Step 2: Chain-of-Thought Implementation (5 minutes)
- Go to section "2. Chain-of-Thought Transaction Analysis"
- You'll see **helpful hints** provided in the prompt structure
- **Your Task**: Use the guided 5-step framework: Data Review → Pattern Recognition → Risk Assessment → Regulatory Analysis → Conclusion
- The prompts are already structured with hints to complete quickly

### 5. Step 3: ReACT Framework Development (5 minutes)
- Move to section "3. ReACT Framework for Investigation"
- Find **guided structure** with example actions provided
- **Your Task**: Use the Observation → Thought → Action cycles with provided framework
- Run the examples to see ReACT methodology in action

### 6. Step 4: Complex Scenario Analysis (3 minutes)
- Proceed to section "4. Complex Suspicious Activity Analysis"
- Apply both CoT and ReACT to challenging scenarios
- **Your Task**: Test your frameworks on multi-layered suspicious patterns
- Compare effectiveness of different reasoning approaches

### 7. Step 5: Performance Comparison (2 minutes)
- Go to section "5. Reasoning Method Comparison"
- Test different prompting approaches on the same scenarios
- **Your Task**: Evaluate when to use CoT vs ReACT approaches
- Document your observations

### 8. Step 6: Reflection (2 minutes)
- Navigate to section "6. Reflection & Best Practices"
- Document your insights about different reasoning methodologies
- **Your Task**: Complete the reflection questions with your observations
- Compare strengths and weaknesses of each approach

## Success Criteria

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:
- ✅ Implement effective Chain-of-Thought prompting for financial analysis
- ✅ Apply ReACT framework to combine reasoning with investigative actions
- ✅ Create transparent, auditable reasoning processes for compliance
- ✅ Analyze complex suspicious activity patterns systematically
- ✅ Compare different reasoning methodologies effectively
- ✅ Understand when to use different reasoning approaches

## Financial Services Context

This exercise focuses on:
- **Transaction Risk Analysis**: Core function requiring systematic reasoning
- **Regulatory Transparency**: Essential for compliance and audit requirements
- **Investigative Workflows**: Combining analysis with actionable next steps
- **Reasoning Methodology Comparison**: Understanding tool selection

## Learning Outcomes

This hands-on practice reinforces:
- Chain-of-Thought and ReACT methodologies from the lesson
