# Lesson 2 Exercise: ReACT Framework with Real Tool Integration

## Exercise Overview: Building Authentic ReACT Systems for Financial Compliance

You've learned about Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for systematic reasoning and ReACT framework for combining reasoning with actions. Now, you'll apply the ReACT methodology to create an AI system that can perform actual financial investigations using real tools and data.

## Exercise: ReACT Framework with Financial Investigation Tools

**File**: `lesson-2-react-tool-integration.ipynb`  
**Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Focus**: Authentic ReACT implementation with real tool usage and JSON integration

---

## The Challenge: Building Real ReACT Systems with Tool Usage

Unlike basic ReACT that just describes actions, this exercise focuses on building ReACT systems that can call real functions, parse JSON responses, and maintain investigation state. You'll create an authentic financial compliance investigation system.

## Your Mission: Creating ReACT with Real Tool Integration

In this exercise, you'll build a complete ReACT system with actual tool usage:

1. **Complete Investigation Tools**: Implement financial investigation functions with real data
2. **Tool Execution System**: Build JSON parsing and tool calling capabilities  
3. **ReACT Workflow**: Create end-to-end investigation process with reasoning

## Key Components You'll Implement

### Investigation Tools (in `investigation_tools.py`)
- **`get_transaction_history()`**: Retrieve account transaction patterns
- **`get_customer_profile()`**: Get customer demographics and risk data
- **`check_regulatory_thresholds()`**: Verify compliance requirements
- **Tool execution framework**: JSON parsing and error handling

### ReACT Investigation System
- **Multi-step reasoning**: LLM decides what tools to use
- **Real tool calls**: Actual function execution with parameters
- **Result integration**: Tool outputs inform next reasoning steps
- **Investigation workflow**: Complete compliance investigation process

## Instructions

### Time Estimate: 15-20 minutes

1. **Setup (2 minutes)**: 
   - Open `lesson-2-react-tool-integration.ipynb`
   - Configure OpenAI client with provided API key

2. **Complete Investigation Tools (5 minutes)**:
   - Implement TODO sections in `investigation_tools.py`
   - Test tools to understand their output format

3. **Build ReACT System (8 minutes)**:
   - Complete ReACT prompt with tool descriptions
   - Implement investigation workflow with tool calling
   - Add JSON parsing and tool execution logic

4. **Run Investigation (3 minutes)**:
   - Execute ReACT investigation on suspicious activity case
   - Compare basic analysis vs ReACT with tools
   - Analyze the improvement in decision quality

5. **Test Custom Scenario (2 minutes)**:
   - Try different customer/account combinations
   - Observe how ReACT adapts investigation approach

## Success Criteria

By completing this exercise, you should be able to:

- ✅ Implement real tools that ReACT systems can use
- ✅ Build proper JSON parsing for tool communication
- ✅ Create complete investigation workflows with tool integration
- ✅ Understand the power of ReACT with actual tool usage vs. simulated actions
- ✅ Apply ReACT methodology to financial compliance scenarios

## Key Learning: Real vs. Simulated ReACT

**Basic ReACT** (just reasoning):
- "I would check the transaction history" ❌
- Speculation-based analysis
- No real data integration

**ReACT with Tools** (what you'll build):
- Actually calls `get_transaction_history()` and processes results ✅
- Data-driven investigation decisions
- Evidence-based compliance recommendations

## Financial Services Context

This exercise demonstrates:
- **Systematic Investigation**: Using tools to gather evidence step-by-step
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Checking actual thresholds and requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of reasoning and actions taken
- **Practical Implementation**: Ready for real-world compliance workflows
