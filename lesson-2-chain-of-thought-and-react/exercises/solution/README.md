# Lesson 2: ReACT Framework with Real Tool Integration - Solution Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the complete solution for implementing authentic ReACT (Reasoning and Acting) methodology with real tool integration for financial compliance investigations.

## Solution Components

### 1. ReACT Tool Integration Solution (`lesson-2-react-tool-integration-solution.ipynb`)

**Purpose**: Demonstrates authentic ReACT implementation with real tool usage and JSON integration

**Key Components**:
- **Real Tool Implementation**: 3 working investigation tools with actual function calls
- **JSON Parsing System**: Proper parsing and validation of tool calls from LLM responses  
- **Complete ReACT Engine**: Full reasoning + acting + observing workflow
- **Investigation Workflow**: End-to-end financial compliance investigation process

### 2. Investigation Tools Module (`investigation_tools.py`)

**Purpose**: Pre-built financial investigation tools for ReACT system integration

**Available Tools**:
1. `get_transaction_history(account_id, days)` - Retrieve account transaction data with different patterns
2. `get_customer_profile(customer_id)` - Get customer risk and demographic information  
3. `check_regulatory_thresholds(amount, type)` - Verify compliance requirements (CTR/SAR/Wire)

**Technical Features**:
- **Complete Tool Implementation**: All functions fully implemented with realistic data patterns
- **JSON Protocol**: Regex-based parsing of tool calls from LLM responses with error handling
- **Tool Registry**: Dictionary mapping tool names to executable functions
- **Execution Pipeline**: `parse_tool_calls()` → `execute_tool()` → result integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid tools, parameters, and execution failures
- **Data Simulation**: Realistic financial scenarios for different customer risk profiles

## Solution Architecture

### Complete ReACT Implementation
The solution notebook demonstrates a full end-to-end ReACT workflow:

1. **Tool Integration Setup**: Imports working investigation tools from `investigation_tools.py`
2. **Tool Demonstration**: Shows each tool's output format and data patterns
3. **ReACT Prompt Engineering**: Comprehensive prompt that teaches LLM tool usage with JSON formatting
4. **Investigation Scenario**: Realistic suspicious activity case (CUST_001 + high_risk_account_001)
5. **Multi-Round Investigation**: Iterative ReACT workflow with tool execution and result integration
6. **Custom Testing Framework**: Template for creating and testing additional scenarios

### Key Code Components
- **`run_react_investigation()`**: Main investigation loop with LLM calls and tool execution
- **`process_tool_calls()`**: Parses JSON from LLM responses and executes tools
- **Investigation workflow**: Maintains context across multiple reasoning iterations
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation for tool failures and invalid parameters
