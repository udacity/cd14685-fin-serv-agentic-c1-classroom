      "- **Customer ID:** CUST_001\n",
      "- **Account ID:** high_risk_account_001\n",
      "- **Time Period:** Past 14 days\n",
      "- **Alert Source:** Branch manager\n",
      "- **Customer Explanation:** \"Restaurant business doing really well\"\n",
      "- **Activity:** Multiple cash deposits just under $10,000\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pattern of Deposits:**\n",
      "   - The customer has made multiple cash deposits just under the $10,000 threshold. This is significant because transactions under $10,000 are often structured to avoid triggering Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs), which raises a red flag for potential money laundering or other illicit activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Customer's Business Type:**\n",
      "   - The customer claims to operate a restaurant, which can be a legitimate cash-intensive business. However, the nature of the business also makes it susceptible to cash-related illicit activities, including money laundering.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Time Frame:**\n",
      "   - The activity has occurred over a short period (14 days), suggesting a potentially urgent need to launder money or conceal the source of funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Customer's Explanation:**\n",
      "   - While the customer claims their business is doing well, it is essential to verify this assertion. A sudden increase in cash deposits without corresponding sales records or other financial documentation could indicate suspicious activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gather Additional Information:**\n",
      "   - Request documentation from the customer that\n",
